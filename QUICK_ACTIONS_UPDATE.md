# Quick Action Buttons - Update Summary

## What Was Added

I've added the quick action buttons you requested to make it easy to mark training data as correct or incorrect.

## New Features

### 1. Quick Action Buttons
- **"✓ This is Correct"** (Green Button)
  - One-click to mark detection and recognition as perfect
  - Automatically fills "Actual" fields with detected values
  - Adds note "Marked as fully correct via quick action"
  - Submits immediately and adds to ML training data
  - Shows success message: "Perfect! This example will be used for ML training."

- **"✗ This is Wrong"** (Red Button)
  - One-click to mark as incorrect
  - Sets both detection and recognition checkboxes to false
  - Prompts you to fill in correct information in "Actual" fields
  - Doesn't submit immediately - lets you make corrections first
  - Shows message: "Please fill in the correct card information..."

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- **Tooltips**: Hover over buttons to see what they do
- **Help Text**: "For fast feedback when the result is obviously right or wrong"
- **Visual Grouping**: Quick actions are in their own section
- **Smart Messaging**: Different success messages for correct vs incorrect examples

### 3. Workflow Options
Now you have three ways to provide feedback:

1. **Quick Correct**: Click "✓ This is Correct" - done in one click!
2. **Quick Wrong**: Click "✗ This is Wrong" - then fill in correct info
3. **Custom**: Use checkboxes and "Submit Custom Feedback" for detailed control

## Usage Examples

### Perfect Detection (Most Common Case):
1. Card is captured
2. Training dialog opens
3. You see the detection is perfect
4. Click "✓ This is Correct"
5. Done! Added to ML training data

### Wrong Detection:
1. Card is captured  
2. Training dialog opens
3. You see the name is wrong
4. Click "✗ This is Wrong"
5. Fill in correct name in "Actual Name" field
6. Click "Submit Custom Feedback"
7. Done! Saved as feedback (not ML training data)

### Partial Issues:
1. Card is captured
2. Training dialog opens
3. Name is right but set is wrong
4. Uncheck "Card was recognized correctly"
5. Fix the "Actual Set" field
6. Click "Submit Custom Feedback"
7. Done! Saved as feedback (not ML training data)

## Benefits

- **Speed**: One click for perfect detections
- **Clarity**: Obvious what each button does
- **Flexibility**: Still have full manual control when needed
- **Quality**: Only perfect examples go to ML training data
- **Efficiency**: Spend time correcting only the wrong ones

The system now makes it super easy to quickly mark good training data while still allowing detailed feedback when needed!
